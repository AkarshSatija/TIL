This is an old command that is mostly equivalent to `git-log`. In fact, the
man page for `git-whatchanged` says:

> New users are encouraged to use git-log(1) instead.

The difference is that `git-whatchanged` shows you the changed files in
their raw format which can be useful if you know what you are looking for.

See `man git-whatchanged` for more details.
